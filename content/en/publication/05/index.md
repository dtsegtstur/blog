In the modern IT world, foreign languages are not just a way to communicate with colleagues from other countries; they are a necessity.  
Here are a few reasons why learning foreign languages is important for an IT specialist:

- **Access to information**: A large portion of IT resources and documentation is available in English, and knowing the language allows you to access information firsthand.
- **Working in international companies**: Many IT companies operate globally, and knowing foreign languages is a huge advantage when searching for jobs.
- **Participation in international projects**: Working on international projects requires IT specialists to know foreign languages to communicate with colleagues from other countries.
- **Cognitive development**: Learning foreign languages develops thinking, memory, and concentration, which is beneficial for any profession, including IT.

Knowledge of foreign languages is not just an additional skill; it is an investment in your future that will help you succeed in the IT field.
